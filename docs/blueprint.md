# **App Name**: Photo Poet

## Core Features:

- Photo Upload: Simple and intuitive photo upload interface.
- Poem Generation: Use generative AI to analyze the image and generate a poem based on the visual content.
- Poem Display: Display the generated poem alongside the uploaded photo.
- Poem length setting: Option to adjust the length of the generated poem, short medium, long.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a color scheme that evokes a sense of nostalgia and creativity. Soft pastels, muted tones, or sepia-inspired colors would work well.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#6a0dad) to evoke a sense of imagination.
- Choose elegant and readable fonts for the poem display. Serif or handwritten-style fonts can add a touch of sophistication.
- A clean and uncluttered layout that places the focus on the photo and the poem. Ensure the poem is easily readable and doesn't compete with the image.
- Subtle animations to create a sense of flow and engagement. For example, a fade-in effect for the poem or a gentle parallax effect for the photo.
